# ConcurrentModificationException in Java ArrayList
This repository demonstrates a common error in Java programming: the `ConcurrentModificationException` when modifying an `ArrayList` while iterating through it.
The `ConcurrentModificationExceptionExample.java` file contains code that produces this exception.  The solution is provided in `ConcurrentModificationExceptionSolution.java`.
The exception arises because the standard for loop directly modifies the underlying list's structure, causing the iterator to become invalid and the exception to be thrown.
The solution demonstrates a safe way to modify the list by using an `Iterator` or creating a new list to avoid this error.
